> **The Smart Screenshot Tool That Thinks Like a Developer**

Stop wrestling with manual screenshot tools and broken feedback loops. **protobooth** automatically discovers your routes, captures consistent screenshots with real data, and creates a seamless client review experience - all designed to disappear when you don't need it anymore.

## 🚨 The 2025 Frontend Feedback Crisis

While tools like Marker.io and zipBoard force you into their rigid workflows, and screenshot services like Percy require complex CI setup, **protobooth** solves the real problem:

❌ **Manual route screenshots** (miss routes, inconsistent data)
❌ **Generic annotation tools** (don't understand your app structure)
❌ **Permanent feedback platforms** (overkill for prototyping)
❌ **Complex CI integrations** (slow, brittle, expensive)

## ✅ The protobooth Difference

Unlike traditional feedback tools, protobooth is **development-aware**:

1. **🧠 Smart Discovery**: Automatically finds ALL your routes (Vite, Next.js)
2. **📸 Fixture-Perfect Screenshots**: Consistent mock data every time
3. **⚡ One-Click Reviews**: "Request Review" → done
4. **🗑️ Disposable**: Self-destructs when prototyping ends

## Key Features

### 🚀 **Zero Configuration Route Discovery** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- **Vite**: Automatically detects routes from `@tanstack/react-router` `createFileRoute()` calls
- **Next.js**: Supports both Pages Router (`/pages/[id].tsx`) and App Router (`/app/user/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **Dynamic Routes**: Extracts parameters from `$userId`, `[id]`, `[...slug]` patterns automatically
- **Smart Filtering**: Excludes protobooth routes and non-page files automatically
- No manual route definitions required

### 🎭 **Fixture-Based Consistency** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- **Mock Authentication**: Define auth state, user data, and permissions
- **Dynamic Route Data**: Provide multiple fixture instances for routes like `/user/[id]`
- **Global State**: Configure theme, language, feature flags for consistent app state
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with Zod validation
- Consistent screenshots across review cycles

### 📱 **Multi-Viewport Screenshots** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- **Playwright Integration**: Reliable headless browser automation
- **Configurable Viewports**: Define custom viewport sizes and names
- **Fixture Injection**: Mock data injected into app context/localStorage before capture
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Generate multiple screenshots per dynamic route
- Responsive design review made simple

### ✏️ **Simple Client Interface**

- Intuitive annotation tools for non-technical users
- No accounts or complex setup required
- Clean staging environment for client reviews

### 📦 **One-Click Download**

- Get feedback as a .zip file with JSON data + marked-up images
- Visual context preserved with annotations overlaid
- Import directly into your development workflow

### 🗑️ **Disposable by Design**

- Built for the prototyping phase only
- Self-destruct when prototyping is complete
- No permanent infrastructure required

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install protobooth
```

### Vite Setup

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { protobooth } from 'protobooth/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    protobooth({
      fixtures: {
        auth: {
          user: { id: 1, name: 'Demo User', role: 'admin' },
          isAuthenticated: true,
          permissions: ['read', 'write']
        },
        dynamicRoutes: {
          '/user/$userId': [
            { userId: '123', name: 'John Doe', role: 'user' },
            { userId: '456', name: 'Jane Smith', role: 'admin' },
          ],
          '/product/$slug': [
            { slug: 'laptop', name: 'Gaming Laptop', price: 1299 },
            { slug: 'mouse', name: 'Wireless Mouse', price: 79 }
          ]
        },
        globalState: {
          theme: 'light',
          language: 'en',
          featureFlags: { newFeature: true }
        }
      },
      viewports: [
        { name: 'mobile', width: 375, height: 667 },
        { name: 'desktop', width: 1440, height: 900 },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Next.js Setup

```javascript
// next.config.js
const { withProtobooth } = require('protobooth/next');

module.exports = withProtobooth({
  experimental: {
    appDir: true, // Enable App Router if using
  },
}, {
  protobooth: {
    fixtures: {
      auth: {
        user: { id: 1, name: 'Next.js Demo User', role: 'admin' },
        isAuthenticated: true,
        permissions: ['read', 'write', 'admin']
      },
      dynamicRoutes: {
        '/user/[id]': [
          { id: '1', name: 'Alice Johnson', role: 'user' },
          { id: '2', name: 'Bob Smith', role: 'admin' },
        ],
        '/blog/[slug]': [
          { slug: 'getting-started', title: 'Getting Started with Next.js' },
          { slug: 'advanced-routing', title: 'Advanced Routing Patterns' }
        ]
      },
      globalState: {
        theme: 'dark',
        language: 'en',
        featureFlags: { newLayout: true }
      }
    },

    ],
  },
});
```

## Workflow

import { protobooth } from 'protobooth/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), protobooth()], // ← That's it
});
```

**🎉 Done!** Visit `localhost:5173/protobooth` and click "Request Review"

## 💡 Pro Tips for 2025

✨ **Smart Fixtures**: Define once, screenshot forever with consistent data
🎯 **Route Patterns**: Automatically handles `/user/[id]`, `/blog/[...slug]`, and more
📱 **Responsive Ready**: Mobile + desktop screenshots out of the box
🚀 **Zero Config**: Works with your existing router setup
🗑️ **Clean Exit**: `npx protobooth cleanup` when you're done

## Requirements

- React 18+ (works with any React framework)
- Modern browser for client reviews
- Staging server for deployment (any static host works)

## Self-Destruct

When prototyping is complete:

```bash
npx protobooth cleanup
```

This removes all protobooth files, configurations, and dependencies while preserving your feedback history for documentation.
