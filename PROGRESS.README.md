## Implementation Guidelines

### Critical Principles to Follow

1. **Simplicity First** - Always choose the simplest solution
2. **SOLID Principles** - Apply during implementation and planning
3. **201-Line Limit** - Keep all `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`, `.scss` files under 201 lines
4. **Test-First Development** - Write tests before implementation for all components
5. **Demo-Driven Testing** - Use real applications to validate screenshot system

### Key Technical Constraints

- **No Database** - Use JSON files for all data storage
- **No Real-time Sync** - Simple file-based download mechanism
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Only essential packages (see dependencies.md)
- **Mock Data Only** - No real authentication, inject mock state

```

## Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

- **Route Discovery**: Automatic from router configuration (not manual route definition)
- **Fixtures**: For mock data only (auth, dynamic routes), not route definitions
- **Screenshots**: Triggered by UI button, not continuous
- **Deployment**: Manual to staging (may automate later with CI/CD)
- **Download Format**: .zip with JSON + marked-up images
- **Naming**: Use actual route values (e.g., `/user/123.png`)

### Screenshot Implementation Decisions

- **Browser Automation**: Playwright only (no Puppeteer abstraction initially)
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests covering complete fixture-injection + screenshot flow
- **Demo App Coverage**: Test against both TanStack Router and Next.js demos for portability
- **Viewport Strategy**: Multi-viewport capture (mobile/desktop) from the start
- **Test Location**: `tests/integration/` for browser automation tests

### UI Implementation Decisions

- **Styling**: SCSS with namespaced class names (`.protobooth-*`) to avoid host app conflicts
- **Route Structure**: Two injected routes - `/protobooth/resolve` (dev) and `/protobooth/annotate` (staging)
- **Route Injection**: Integrate directly with host app's dev server router (Vite/Next.js)
- **State Persistence**: File-based state storage for dev server restart resilience
- **Testing Focus**: Integration tests for route injection process and full workflow
- **Staging Simulation**: Development mode supports simulating staging environment for annotation UI development

### Technology Decisions

- **Headless Browser**: Playwright (with Puppeteer alternative)
- **Canvas Library**: Fabric.js for annotation tools
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for downloading annotations
- **Validation**: Zod for fixture and annotation schemas
- **File Operations**: fs-extra for JSON storage

  - 📝 **Next Steps** (Prioritized per Q&A.md decisions):
    - [ ] **PRIORITY 1: Build AnnotateApp Component** (TDD approach - RED → GREEN → REFACTOR):
      - [ ] Phase 1 (RED): Write 12-16 failing integration tests split into 4 files:
        - `annotate-app-tools.test.tsx` - Canvas tool interactions
        - `annotate-app-annotations.test.tsx` - Annotation CRUD operations
        - `annotate-app-publish.test.tsx` - Publish workflow
        - `annotate-app-errors.test.tsx` - Error scenarios
      - [ ] Phase 2 (GREEN): Build minimal AnnotateApp implementation:
        - Reuse Core components (Button, Layout, Sidebar, etc.)
        - Create Annotate-specific components (Canvas with Fabric.js, AnnotationForm, PublishButton, ToolPalette)
        - All components under 201 lines
        - ALWAYS use testIds, NEVER text-based queries
      - [ ] Phase 3 (REFACTOR): Improve code quality while maintaining 100% test pass rate
    - [ ] **PRIORITY 2: Implement Route Injection** (After AnnotateApp works):
      - [ ] TDD approach: Write integration tests for Vite plugin first
      - [ ] Test route discovery, injection, and exclusion with demos/tanstack-router
      - [ ] Implement Vite plugin (under 201 lines)
      - [ ] Repeat for Next.js plugin with demos/nextjs
    - [ ] **PRIORITY 3: Connect Real Services** (After route injection works):
      - [ ] Implement RealFileOperations using fs-extra
      - [ ] Implement RealScreenshotService using Playwright
      - [ ] Implement RealFixtureManager with fixture loading
      - [ ] Use dependency injection pattern (already established)
      - [ ] Keep mock implementations for tests
    - [ ] **PRIORITY 4: REFACTOR Phase** (After everything works):
      - [ ] Extract shared patterns (ViewContainer component)
      - [ ] Create useWorkflowTransitions hook
      - [ ] Consolidate duplicate type definitions
      - [ ] Maintain 100% test pass rate (165+ tests) throughout
      - [ ] Keep all files under 201 lines
- 🎯 **CURRENT FOCUS**: Ready to start AnnotateApp TDD cycle (Priority 1) - see Q&A.md "Next Steps Planning" section for detailed approach

## Blockers & Questions

**Current Blockers**: None - ready for implementation

**Questions Resolved** (see Q&A.md "Next Steps Planning" section):

✅ **Priority for next development steps?**
- Decision: Build AnnotateApp first → Route Injection → Real Services → REFACTOR
- Rationale: Completes full workflow, follows TDD, delivers user-facing value

✅ **How to approach AnnotateApp with TDD?**
- Decision: Follow same successful pattern as ResolveApp (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Tests first: 12-16 integration tests in 4 files (under 201 lines each)
- ALWAYS use testIds, NEVER text-based queries

✅ **Real services or mocks?**
- Decision: BOTH - mocks for tests (fast), real implementations for production
- Use dependency injection pattern already established in ResolveApp.props

✅ **How to test route injection?**
- Decision: TDD with demo applications (demos/tanstack-router, demos/nextjs)
- Write integration tests first, then implement plugins

✅ **What needs refactoring?**
- Decision: Do LAST after everything works
- Focus: Component composition, hook extraction, type consolidation
- Rule: Maintain 100% test pass rate throughout
