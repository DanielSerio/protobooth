## Implementation Guidelines

### Critical Principles to Follow

1. **Simplicity First** - Always choose the simplest solution
2. **SOLID Principles** - Apply during implementation and planning
3. **201-Line Limit** - Keep all `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`, `.scss` files under 201 lines
4. **Test-First Development** - Write tests before implementation for all components
5. **Demo-Driven Testing** - Use real applications to validate screenshot system

### Key Technical Constraints

- **No Database** - Use JSON files for all data storage
- **No Real-time Sync** - Simple file-based download mechanism
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Only essential packages (see dependencies.md)
- **Mock Data Only** - No real authentication, inject mock state

### File Structure to Implement

```
protobooth/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/               # Fixture management, workflow, file storage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screenshot/         # Browser service, capture logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ staging/           # Client annotation UI and storage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ development/       # Developer resolution UI and download

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared/           # Shared demo components and utilities
```

## Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

- **Route Discovery**: Automatic from router configuration (not manual route definition)
- **Fixtures**: For mock data only (auth, dynamic routes), not route definitions
- **Screenshots**: Triggered by UI button, not continuous
- **Deployment**: Manual to staging (may automate later with CI/CD)
- **Download Format**: .zip with JSON + marked-up images
- **Naming**: Use actual route values (e.g., `/user/123.png`)

### Screenshot Implementation Decisions

- **Browser Automation**: Playwright only (no Puppeteer abstraction initially)
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests covering complete fixture-injection + screenshot flow
- **Demo App Coverage**: Test against both TanStack Router and Next.js demos for portability
- **Viewport Strategy**: Multi-viewport capture (mobile/desktop) from the start
- **Test Location**: `tests/integration/` for browser automation tests

### UI Implementation Decisions

- **Styling**: SCSS with namespaced class names (`.protobooth-*`) to avoid host app conflicts
- **Route Structure**: Two injected routes - `/protobooth/resolve` (dev) and `/protobooth/annotate` (staging)
- **Route Injection**: Integrate directly with host app's dev server router (Vite/Next.js)
- **State Persistence**: File-based state storage for dev server restart resilience
- **Testing Focus**: Integration tests for route injection process and full workflow
- **Staging Simulation**: Development mode supports simulating staging environment for annotation UI development

### Technology Decisions

- **Headless Browser**: Playwright (with Puppeteer alternative)
- **Canvas Library**: Fabric.js for annotation tools
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for downloading annotations
- **Validation**: Zod for fixture and annotation schemas
- **File Operations**: fs-extra for JSON storage

## Blockers & Questions

**Current Blockers**: None - ready for implementation

**Questions for Next Session**:

- None - all clarifications completed in planning phase

## Test-First Implementation Priority

1. **Demo Applications**: Create testing environments first
2. **Router Discovery**: Write tests then implement (simplest component)
3. **Fixture Management**: Test-driven fixture system development
4. **Screenshot Capture**: Test with demo apps then implement
5. **UI Components**: Test-driven development for both UIs
6. **Download Mechanism**: Test-driven implementation
7. **End-to-End Validation**: Full workflow testing with demo apps
8. **Package and Publish**: Final integration testing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Developer can define fixtures in config
- [ ] "Request Review" button captures screenshots with fixture data
- [ ] Screenshots deployed to staging with annotation UI
- [ ] Clients can annotate and "Publish" feedback
- [ ] Developers can download .zip with JSON + marked-up images
- [ ] Full workflow cycle completes successfully
- [ ] Package installs and integrates with Vite/Next.js projects
