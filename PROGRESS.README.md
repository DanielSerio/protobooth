## Implementation Guidelines

### Critical Principles to Follow

1. **Simplicity First** - Always choose the simplest solution
2. **SOLID Principles** - Apply during implementation and planning
3. **201-Line Limit** - Keep all `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`, `.scss` files under 201 lines
4. **Test-First Development** - Write tests before implementation for all components
5. **Demo-Driven Testing** - Use real applications to validate screenshot system

### Key Technical Constraints

- **No Database** - Use JSON files for all data storage
- **No Real-time Sync** - Simple file-based download mechanism
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Only essential packages (see dependencies.md)
- **Mock Data Only** - No real authentication, inject mock state

```

## Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

- **Route Discovery**: Automatic from router configuration (not manual route definition)
- **Fixtures**: For mock data only (auth, dynamic routes), not route definitions
- **Screenshots**: Triggered by UI button, not continuous
- **Deployment**: Manual to staging (may automate later with CI/CD)
- **Download Format**: .zip with JSON + marked-up images
- **Naming**: Use actual route values (e.g., `/user/123.png`)

### Screenshot Implementation Decisions

- **Browser Automation**: Playwright only (no Puppeteer abstraction initially)
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests covering complete fixture-injection + screenshot flow
- **Demo App Coverage**: Test against both TanStack Router and Next.js demos for portability
- **Viewport Strategy**: Multi-viewport capture (mobile/desktop) from the start
- **Test Location**: `tests/integration/` for browser automation tests

### UI Implementation Decisions

- **Styling**: SCSS with single `.protobooth` wrapper class at root to avoid host app conflicts (not prefixing every class)
- **Route Structure**: Two injected routes - `/protobooth/resolve` (dev) and `/protobooth/annotate` (staging)
- **Route Injection**: Integrate directly with host app's dev server router (Vite/Next.js)
- **State Persistence**: File-based state storage for dev server restart resilience
- **Testing Focus**: Integration tests for route injection process and full workflow
- **Staging Simulation**: Development mode supports simulating staging environment for annotation UI development

### Technology Decisions

- **Headless Browser**: Playwright (with Puppeteer alternative)
- **Canvas Library**: Fabric.js for annotation tools
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for downloading annotations
- **Validation**: Zod for fixture and annotation schemas
- **File Operations**: fs-extra for JSON storage

### Session 5 (2025-10-04)

- 🚀 **TANSTACK ROUTER DYNAMIC ROUTE EXPANSION FIXED** (TDD RED → GREEN cycle):
  - ✅ **Phase 1 (RED)**: Identified screenshot count bug
    - ✅ Investigated discrepancy: 27 screenshots reported, only 18 files created
    - ✅ Root cause: `DefaultRouteInstanceGenerator` only supported Next.js `[param]` syntax
    - ✅ TanStack Router `$param` syntax not recognized, routes returned unexpanded
    - ✅ Filenames overwrote: `product_$slug_desktop.png` used for both `laptop` and `mouse` fixtures
    - ✅ Wrote 7 comprehensive failing tests in `route-instance-generator-tanstack.test.ts`
  - ✅ **Phase 2 (GREEN)**: Implemented TanStack Router support
    - ✅ Added `$param` regex pattern matching to `DefaultRouteInstanceGenerator`
    - ✅ Routes now properly expand: `/product/$slug` → `/product/laptop`, `/product/mouse`
    - ✅ Multi-parameter support: `/shop/$category/$slug` works correctly
    - ✅ Empty fixture handling: Returns `[]` for dynamic routes without fixtures (was returning unexpanded route)
    - ✅ Mixed syntax support: Next.js `[param]` and TanStack `$param` both work in same codebase
    - ✅ All 7 new tests passing + 241 existing tests = **248 total tests passing**
  - ✅ **Screenshot System Validation**:
    - ✅ **Correct count**: 27 screenshots now created (9 routes × 3 viewports)
      - 4 static routes: `/`, `/about`, `/dashboard`, `/products`
      - 2 product fixtures: `/product/laptop`, `/product/mouse`
      - 3 user fixtures: `/user/123`, `/user/456`, `/user/789`
    - ✅ **Correct naming**: Filenames use fixture values
      - `product_laptop_desktop.png`, `product_laptop_mobile.png`, `product_laptop_tablet.png`
      - `product_mouse_desktop.png`, `product_mouse_mobile.png`, `product_mouse_tablet.png`
      - `user_123_desktop.png`, `user_456_desktop.png`, `user_789_desktop.png`, etc.
    - ✅ **No overwrites**: Each fixture creates unique screenshot files
  - ✅ **Browser Bundle Fix**:
    - ✅ Fixed `process.cwd()` usage in browser code (`useResolveHandlers.ts`)
    - ✅ Changed from `process.cwd()` to empty string (server uses its own `projectRoot`)
    - ✅ Eliminated "process is not defined" browser error
    - ✅ Maintained separation of browser and server code
  - ✅ **Enhanced Debugging**:
    - ✅ Added console logging to `FixtureManager.generateRouteInstances()`
    - ✅ Added console logging to `ScreenshotCaptureService.generateRouteInstances()`
    - ✅ Added console logging to `ScreenshotCaptureService.captureRoutes()`
    - ✅ Logging shows: fixtures found, routes processed, instances generated
  - ✅ **TypeScript Fixes**:
    - ✅ Fixed `src/next.ts` type errors in middleware function signature
    - ✅ Changed from specific types to `unknown` with type assertions
    - ✅ Maintained type safety without causing union type conflicts

## Blockers & Questions

**Current Blockers**: None - ready for implementation

**Questions Resolved** (see Q&A.md "Next Steps Planning" section):

✅ **Priority for next development steps?**
- Decision: Build AnnotateApp first → Route Injection → Real Services → REFACTOR
- Rationale: Completes full workflow, follows TDD, delivers user-facing value

✅ **How to approach AnnotateApp with TDD?**
- Decision: Follow same successful pattern as ResolveApp (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Tests first: 12-16 integration tests in 4 files (under 201 lines each)
- ALWAYS use testIds, NEVER text-based queries

✅ **Real services or mocks?**
- Decision: BOTH - mocks for tests (fast), real implementations for production
- Use dependency injection pattern already established in ResolveApp.props

✅ **How to test route injection?**
- Decision: TDD with demo applications (demos/tanstack-router, demos/nextjs)
- Write integration tests first, then implement plugins

✅ **What needs refactoring?**
- Decision: Do LAST after everything works
- Focus: Component composition, hook extraction, type consolidation
- Rule: Maintain 100% test pass rate throughout

## Test-First Implementation Priority (Updated per Q&A.md)

**PRIORITY 1: AnnotateApp Component (TDD)**
1. **Write failing tests** (RED) - 12-16 integration tests in 4 files
2. **Build minimal implementation** (GREEN) - Reuse Core components, Fabric.js canvas
3. **Refactor for quality** (REFACTOR) - Maintain 100% test pass rate

**PRIORITY 2: Route Injection (TDD)**
4. **Write plugin tests** - Integration tests for Vite plugin with demos/tanstack-router
5. **Implement Vite plugin** - Route discovery, injection, exclusion (under 201 lines)
6. **Write Next.js tests** - Integration tests with demos/nextjs
7. **Implement Next.js plugin** - App Router and Pages Router support

**PRIORITY 3: Real Services (TDD)**
8. **Write service tests** - Integration tests for real file operations
9. **Implement RealFileOperations** - Using fs-extra (under 201 lines)
10. **Implement RealScreenshotService** - Using Playwright (under 201 lines)
11. **Implement RealFixtureManager** - Fixture loading (under 201 lines)

**PRIORITY 4: REFACTOR**
12. **Extract shared patterns** - Component composition, hook extraction
13. **Consolidate types** - Reduce duplication in type definitions
14. **Final E2E validation** - Full workflow testing with real demo apps
