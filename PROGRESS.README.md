## Implementation Guidelines

### Critical Principles to Follow

1. **Simplicity First** - Always choose the simplest solution
2. **SOLID Principles** - Apply during implementation and planning
3. **201-Line Limit** - Keep all `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`, `.scss` files under 201 lines
4. **Test-First Development** - Write tests before implementation for all components
5. **Demo-Driven Testing** - Use real applications to validate screenshot system

### Key Technical Constraints

- **No Database** - Use JSON files for all data storage
- **No Real-time Sync** - Simple file-based download mechanism
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Only essential packages (see dependencies.md)
- **Mock Data Only** - No real authentication, inject mock state

```

## Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

- **Route Discovery**: Automatic from router configuration (not manual route definition)
- **Fixtures**: For mock data only (auth, dynamic routes), not route definitions
- **Screenshots**: Triggered by UI button, not continuous
- **Deployment**: Manual to staging (may automate later with CI/CD)
- **Download Format**: .zip with JSON + marked-up images
- **Naming**: Use actual route values (e.g., `/user/123.png`)

### Screenshot Implementation Decisions

- **Browser Automation**: Playwright only (no Puppeteer abstraction initially)
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests covering complete fixture-injection + screenshot flow
- **Demo App Coverage**: Test against both TanStack Router and Next.js demos for portability
- **Viewport Strategy**: Multi-viewport capture (mobile/desktop) from the start
- **Test Location**: `tests/integration/` for browser automation tests

### UI Implementation Decisions

- **Styling**: SCSS with namespaced class names (`.protobooth-*`) to avoid host app conflicts
- **Route Structure**: Two injected routes - `/protobooth/resolve` (dev) and `/protobooth/annotate` (staging)
- **Route Injection**: Integrate directly with host app's dev server router (Vite/Next.js)
- **State Persistence**: File-based state storage for dev server restart resilience
- **Testing Focus**: Integration tests for route injection process and full workflow
- **Staging Simulation**: Development mode supports simulating staging environment for annotation UI development

### Technology Decisions

- **Headless Browser**: Playwright (with Puppeteer alternative)
- **Canvas Library**: Fabric.js for annotation tools
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for downloading annotations
- **Validation**: Zod for fixture and annotation schemas
- **File Operations**: fs-extra for JSON storage

## Blockers & Questions

**Current Blockers**: None - ready for implementation

**Questions Resolved** (see Q&A.md "Next Steps Planning" section):

✅ **Priority for next development steps?**
- Decision: Build AnnotateApp first → Route Injection → Real Services → REFACTOR
- Rationale: Completes full workflow, follows TDD, delivers user-facing value

✅ **How to approach AnnotateApp with TDD?**
- Decision: Follow same successful pattern as ResolveApp (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Tests first: 12-16 integration tests in 4 files (under 201 lines each)
- ALWAYS use testIds, NEVER text-based queries

✅ **Real services or mocks?**
- Decision: BOTH - mocks for tests (fast), real implementations for production
- Use dependency injection pattern already established in ResolveApp.props

✅ **How to test route injection?**
- Decision: TDD with demo applications (demos/tanstack-router, demos/nextjs)
- Write integration tests first, then implement plugins

✅ **What needs refactoring?**
- Decision: Do LAST after everything works
- Focus: Component composition, hook extraction, type consolidation
- Rule: Maintain 100% test pass rate throughout

## Test-First Implementation Priority (Updated per Q&A.md)

**PRIORITY 1: AnnotateApp Component (TDD)**
1. **Write failing tests** (RED) - 12-16 integration tests in 4 files

8. **Write service tests** - Integration tests for real file operations
9. **Implement RealFileOperations** - Using fs-extra (under 201 lines)
10. **Implement RealScreenshotService** - Using Playwright (under 201 lines)
11. **Implement RealFixtureManager** - Fixture loading (under 201 lines)

**PRIORITY 4: REFACTOR**
